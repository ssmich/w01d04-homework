// 1. Verbal Questions
// 		1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

//		A parameter is the input variable for a function. An argument 
//		is the value assigned to the parameter.

//		2. Within a function, what is the difference between return 
// 		   and console.log?

//		Return specifies a value to be returned and terminates the code
//		within a fuction. Console.log prints and does not return a value
//		and is therefore undefined. 

//		3. What are the implications of the ability of a function to 
//		   return a value?

//		Return must be included in the function as the last step.
